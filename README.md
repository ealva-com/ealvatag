eAlvaTag
========

*eAlvaTag* is a Java API for reading and writing tag information of audio 
files. The follow types are currently supported:

- Mp3
- Flac
- OggVorbis
- Mp4
- Aiff
- Wav
- Wma
- Dsf

Until the version of this library reaches 1.0, you should consider the API to 
be very unstable (no Semantic Versioning until 1.0.0 and later). Pull requests 
welcome.

Quick Start
-----------
```java
 class Test {
  public void test() {
      TagOptionSingleton.getInstance().isAndroid = true;  // Android - put in Application.onCreate()
      File inputFile = new File("MyFavoriteSong.mp3");
      AudioFile audioFile = AudioFileIO.read(inputFile);
    
      final AudioHeader audioHeader = audioFile.getAudioHeader();
      final int channels = audioHeader.getChannelCount();
      final int bitRate = audioHeader.getBitRate();
      final String encodingType = audioHeader.getEncodingType();
    
      Tag tag = audioFile.getTag().or(NullTag.INSTANCE);
      final String title = tag.getValue(FieldKey.TITLE).or("");
      if ("".equals(title)) {
        if (tag == NullTag.INSTANCE) {
          // there was no tag. set a new default tag for the file type
          tag = audioFile.setNewDefaultTag();
        }
      }
    
      tag.setField(FieldKey.TITLE, "My New Title");
      audioFile.save();
    
      final ImmutableSet<FieldKey> supportedFields = tag.getSupportedFields();
      if (supportedFields.contains(FieldKey.COVER_ART)) {
        System.out.println("File type supports Artwork");
      }
    }
  }
```

eAlvaLog is a very thin facade used by eAlvaTag for logging purposes. Each Logger instance created by eAlvaTag logs all output with a 
Marker found at ealvatag.logging.Log.MARKER. This allows for easy filtering so log output can be directed and/or filtered as needed. 
eAlvaLog provides a very light Android specific LoggerFactory if you only need log to the Android log. If using the java.util.logging 
logger framework, you may also add a handler at Loggers.INSTANCE.get("ealvatag") to add a Handler specifically for eAlvaTag library log output. 
See [eAlvaLog](https://github.com/ealva-com/ealvalog) for more details on configuring logging. 

Add eAlvaTag to your project
----------------------------
Gradle:
```gradle
compile 'com.ealva:ealvatag:0.4.6'
```

Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.ealva</groupId>
    <artifactId>ealvatag</artifactId>
    <version>0.4.6</version>
</dependency>
```

Dependencies
------------
 [Square's Okio](https://github.com/square/okio)
    Used for reading mp3 and mp4 files and will be further integrated. The segment pooling dramatically increased read performance over Jdk stream/file IO.
    
    implementation 'com.squareup.okio:okio:2.9.0'

 [Google's Guava](https://github.com/google/guava)
    Used for Optional<>, Immutable collections, and general utilities
     
    implementation 'com.google.guava:guava:20.0'

 [eAlvaLog](https://github.com/ealva-com/ealvalog)
    Thin logging facade. Only the API is used in this library. For users of this library it currently supports the java.util.logging 
    Logger and Android logging. It should be very easy to write a facade implementation for another logging framework if it's not already
    provided.

History
-------

This library started as Entagged Audio Tag library which was forked into 
[Jaudiotagger][1]. Jaudiotagger is still under active development at this time 
(January 2017)

Jaudiotagger was forked into this library, eAlvaTag for 2 primary reasons: to
upgrade the license to GNU LGPLv3 and to focus on Android compatibility. 
GNU LGPLv3 is necessary to link to Apache License Version 2.0 libraries. As for
Android compatibility, the previous library was dependent on java.nio library
components not available on Android versions in current use. Also, quite a bit
of refactoring was needed to make the library more [performant][2] on the Android
platform.
